# Tron-crypto-coin-prediction-using-XGBoost-algorithm


Tron coin is a decentralised block chain digital currency. This project is devoted to perform the crypto coin prediction using Extreme Gradient Boost algorithm. The prediction output is fairly accurate with the original data.

Motivation for selection of algorithm:
The XGBoost algorithm is flexible and utilizes parallel processing. It is faster than gradient boosting. It is capable of handling missing data scenarios. It supports cross-validation after every iteration. The Covid 19 resulted in unfortunate scenarios. There have been high alterations in the price of the cryptocurrency. The Tron coin has gone through its all  time high price and also faced more than 60% loss in the year 2021 alone. By this we can guess the alterations of the Tron coin price in the year 2021 itself. The XGBoost algorithm can handle such deviations in the data with the help of tree pruning technique. By considering these advantages, we choose the XGBoost algorithm to perform the price prediction.
